 * using [IdentityService.verifyAnonymousIdentity].
 *
 * Although similar to [VerifiedParty], the two distinct types exist in order to minimise risk of mixing up
 * confidential and well known identities. In contrast to [VerifiedParty] equality tests are based on the anonymous
 * party's key rather than name, which is the appropriate test for confidential parties but not for well known identities.
